<h2 align="center"> General Guidelines </h2>

### Please follow these general guidelines to keep the repo clean and manageable

*   Always be clear what you are doing
*   Check your changes (commit) before pushing
*   Don't ever force push that will create the chaos i.e., never use `git push origin master --force` instead first `git pull origin master` and then after `git push origin master`
*   Commit short description
    *   clearly mention summary of changes done
    *   Limit your description to 20-30 characters (**not** words)
    *   If you are referring to issue, tag the issue not like [fix #13]
*   Commit long description
    *   Its optional but there is no harm in having it.
    *   Please follow 70-75 char rule per line
*   Try to bundle you commit as the feature or bug fixes
*   If you aren't sure how to bundle your changes (commits). Push it into new branch and create issue for some one to look over it!
